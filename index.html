			Hello World in IntelliJ - First Experience With an IDE</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I come from a coding bootcamp background (I attended Flatiron School). Being in the web development class, my first language was Ruby and my coding environment was pretty much just Sublime Text (though more recently Atom). With Ruby as a first language, IDEs can seem to be pretty alien. What&rsquo;s the point? Isn&rsquo;t everything I need just in a simple text editor? These are the questions I had when Ruby was the only language I knew. While there are Ruby IDEs out there, you can get by with no trouble just using a text editor.</p>

<p>I ran into my first feeling that I needed an IDE when I started learning Java. It was very different from Ruby. I needed to get used to a static language. Arrays that needed to know what size they were, variables to be declared and remembering to compile a program before running it. I admit that my first Java program (a simple shopping cart reader that would get its input from a text file and give a receipt as an output after calculating item totals and tax) was programmed entirely on sublime and while coding, I kept thinking - This feels a lot harder than it should be. After the horrified look I got from a friend when I mentioned I was coding Java on a text editor, he recommended IntelliJ as an IDE to use. And that is where I am now.</p>

<p>So to start off&hellip; what is an IDE?</p>

<p>IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. IntelliJ doesn&rsquo;t just give a platform for writing code on, but it also contains a compiler, built-in debugging (way better than my beloved binding.pry), and a very helpful autocomplete.</p>

<p>This all seems great!</p>

<p>One of my main issues from my first Java program was just forgetting to compile and so on&hellip; it was an extra step that I didn&rsquo;t need to do with Ruby. However, just getting started on an IDE having never encountered one before has led me to see that there is a learning curve. With a text editor, I could hit the ground running and immediately start writing code. But there is some familiarity that needs to be developed with an IDE and learning one is a challenge in and of itself.</p>

<p>As you can see from the title of this blog post, this is just a simple guide on creating a Hello World program with IntelliJ. (The pictures might look a little bit small but they expand if you click on them.) This post also helps me document my learning progress.</p>

<p>Step 1: Create a new project</p>

<p>When you open up IntelliJ, click on the option to make a new project.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/intellij1.png" width = 400>
</center>


<p>Step 2: Navigate through the options and select the command line app template.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve clicked new project, you are given the option to include additional libraries and frameworks. If you click next (because we&rsquo;re not using any), you&rsquo;ll get to the template selection page. We&rsquo;re just making a hello world program so we&rsquo;ll just pick the command line app template.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/intellij2.png" width = 400><img src="/images/intellij2a.png" width = 400>
</center>


<p>Step 3: Name the project and choose its location</p>

<p>I already had a folder called HelloWorld made.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/intellij3.png" width = 400>
</center>


<p>Step 4: Write the code</p>

<p>Selecting the command line template makes the public static void appear automatically. So we just need to fill in the rest. While writing, it was nice to see the auto-complete. It&rsquo;s helpful to be able to see the methods you have available to you.</p>

</center>


<p>Step 5: Running the code</p>

<p>To run the code and see &ldquo;hello world!&rdquo; printed out, we just need to hit the green triangle on the top right of the window.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/intellij5.png" width = 400>
</center>


<p>And there you have it, my first attempt at trying to familiarize myself a little bit with the absolute basics of IntelliJ before really diving into it. It was definitely a little strange for me at first, coming over from Ruby for the need of an IDE. But I can already tell that if I had written my Java shopping cart reader with IntelliJ, it would have saved me a lot of time in the long run. Overall, I can tell that using an IDE is a lot more powerful but it does have a steeper learning curve when compared to the text editors that I am more familiar with.</p>

			First Forays With Gosu - That One Bouncing DvD Logo</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During my free time, I&rsquo;ve been working my way through <strong>Learn Game Programming with Ruby </strong>. It&rsquo;s a pretty fun book and can be picked up: <a href = 'https://pragprog.com/book/msgpkids/learn-game-programming-with-ruby'>HERE</a></p>

<p>It uses Ruby and the Gosu 2D game library which makes making simple games pretty easy. I&rsquo;ve just made my way through the first four chapters which walks you through the creation of a whack-a-mole game (except you are trying to hit a blinking bouncing ruby). It goes through animating your images, keeping score, and how to make a time limit for your game. I really recommend the book so far if you&rsquo;re just starting out with Ruby and looking for something fun and simple.</p>

<p>Having finished the first project in the book, I decided to do some quick review on what I have learned with Gosu and make that one bouncing DvD logo thing. You know, the one you keep watching to see if it hits the corner of the TV?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still not sure, check out this clip from The Office that explains it all:</p>

<center>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmFEK2gq4QQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a gif that shows what my final product looks like:<br><br></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/finishedDvD.gif">
</center>


<p>Note that the actual program runs smoothly. It&rsquo;s just a bad gif that is not in a perfect loop so the frame rate is terrible.</p>

<p>First things first, we are going to have to make a window appear. To do this, we are going to start off by making a subclass of Gosu::Window. In our initialize method, we are also going to tell Gosu what size we want our window to be. So we use super to pass in the dimensions of the window. Notice that right at the bottom when we call the show method? We didn&rsquo;t write a method called show but it is included in Gosu.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>require 'gosu' # Remember to require gosu!
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>class BounceDvD &lt; Gosu::Window
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  def initialize
</span><span class='line'>    super(800, 600)
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>window = BounceDvD.new
</span><span class='line'>window.show</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Right now, when we run the program, a blank window should appear. For the next thing, let&rsquo;s draw the image of the DvD logo onto the window. So we are going to add a draw method to our code. In the draw method, the first two arguments are going to be the x and y axis our image is going to be placed on. If you look below, we can see that Gosu is going to place our logo 30 px from the left and 30 px from the top (It measures this from the top left of our image, not from image center). The third argument is the z-axis. For example, if we had another logo with a higher z, it will be layered on top of our original logo. Finally, the other two arguments is the scale for x and y. Because the picture I picked has a pretty big size, I needed to scale it down so that it would fit in the window.</p>

</span><span class='line'>window = BounceDvD.new
</span><span class='line'>window.show</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once we run that code above, we should open up a window and we can see the DvD logo.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/stillDvD.png" width = 400>
</center>


<p>Next, we are going to try to move the logo. To do this, we are going to fill up the update method. In our initialize method, we are going to create two more variables for velocity. It will determine how much our logo will be moving. Then, in update, we will add the velocity numbers to our current x and y value. Basically, the logo&rsquo;s position in the window will be continuously updating by however much the velocity is.</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>window = BounceDvD.new
</span><span class='line'>window.show</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, here we are going to run into a problem. We want our logo to bounce on the screen once it meets the edge. Our program right now is always adding the velocity to our logo&rsquo;s position so it will eventually just move off the edge of the screen like so.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/offtheedge.gif">
</center>


<p>To fix this, our velocity will have to become negative once it hits an edge. That way, it will bounce back instead of continuing onwards. Whenever the logo hits an edge, we want it to reverse directions. We can tinker around with the update method even more and get this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def update
</span><span class='line'>    @x += @velocity_x
</span><span class='line'>    @y += @velocity_y
</span><span class='line'>    if @x &gt; 800 || @x &lt; 0
</span><span class='line'>      @velocity_x *= -1
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>    if @y &gt; 600 || @y &lt; 0
</span><span class='line'>      @velocity_y *= -1
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The numbers of 800 and 600 come from the window size we had defined in the initialize method. And we also have @x &lt; 0 and @y &lt; 0 to make sure it will bounce on all edges. The velocity gets reversed by multiplying it by -1 to create the bounce. The following gif illustrates the result:</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/clipping.gif">
</center>


<p>It still isn&rsquo;t quite right. Remember that our image&rsquo;s placement in the window is decided by its upper left corner? So notice that in the gif, it actually only bounces on that corner. So while the left and top part of the window looks okay, the bottom and right side shows the logo clipping out of the window&rsquo;s view. It isn&rsquo;t what we want. We would like it to actually bounce on the logo&rsquo;s right side, not just its corner. We can do a little maths and fix this by expanding on the if statement in the update method. Our image size is 120 x 120 so if we subtract the window&rsquo;s size by that amount, we should be able to find when the logo should bounce. Like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def update
</span><span class='line'>    @x += @velocity_x
</span><span class='line'>    @y += @velocity_y
</span><span class='line'>    if @x &gt; 800 || @x &lt; 0 || @x &gt; 800 - 120
</span><span class='line'>      @velocity_x *= -1
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>    if @y &gt; 600 || @y &lt; 0 || @y &gt; 600 - 120
</span><span class='line'>      @velocity_y *= -1
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><br>
And great! The result should now be bouncing on the edge of the logo. It was a really quick and easy exercise. The full code can be seen: <a href = 'https://github.com/heatherlim/bouncingdvdtest'> HERE </a></p>

<p>Hopefully this demonstrates how easy it is to get started with gosu and animating with Ruby.</p>

<p>But what if you wanted to calculate using more than one operation? Or be even more flexible and let a user pass in a string to calculate? In this situation, order of operations becomes something to take note of. When researching this, I stumbled upon polish notation (also called prefix notation) and the use of stacks as a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Polish notation is a different way to write arithmatic. The operator is placed to the left of the operand. This was initially strange to me because I was used to infix notation. In infix, we place the operator in between the operands we are calculating. I did not realize there was any other way and infix was the most intuitive to me. It&rsquo;s the more conventional way we read expressions.</p>

<p>An example of infix:<br>
2 + 3</p>

<p>An example of prefix:<br>
+ 2 3</p>

<p>While infix might be easier for me to read, I found that when trying to make a calculator, prefix was easier for a computer. One reason is that the rules of order of operations becomes unnecessary with prefix. When trying to calculate infix, there are a lot of rules to keep in mind.</p>

<p>For example:<br>
(5 - 6) * 7</p>

<p>We need to evaluate what is within the parenthesis first. Also, if there were no parenthesis, we would have to calculate 6 * 7 first as multiplication comes before subtraction. Parenthesis are very necessary in infix as they can change what an expression evaluates to with removal.</p>

<p>The same expression however, when written in prefix does not need parenthesis:<br>
* - 5 6 7</p>

<p>The order in which a prefix is calculated is always going to be conveyed by how it is arranged. All prefix expressions are calculated in the same way. To further elaborate:</p>

<p>With infix, finding the innermost expression to calculate first is difficult. It requires a lot of jumping around in the expression. <br>
((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1))</p>

<p>But if it was written in prefix:<br>
- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 + 2 + 1 1</p>

<p>This prefix expression is calculated in the same way that our previous simple example (+ 2 3) is calculated. We do not even need to memorize the order of operations. Example below on what I mean.</p>

<p>Calculating Prefix Step by Step:<br>
- Read from right to left<br>
- Look for two operands and their operator and evaluate them</p>

<p>- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 + 2 <strong>+ 1 1</strong></p>

<p>Now we can evaluate them:<br>
- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 + 2 <strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Repeat:<br>
- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 4</p>

<p>Our next two operands and operators are selected again. From right to left, the two operands next to their operator will be:<br>
- * / 15 - 7 <strong>+ 1 1</strong> 3 4<br>
<em>(As you can see, from this example, just calculating prefix in this way does not need a knowledge of order of operations&hellip; there&rsquo;s no jumping around in an expression. You just have to follow <strong> one </strong> rule)</em></p>

<p>This is what we have now:<br>
- * / 15 <strong>- 7 2</strong> 3 4<br>
We can see the next two to caclulate is - 7 2&hellip; and so on&hellip;<br>
- * <strong>/ 15 5 </strong>3 4 <br>
- <strong>* 3 3</strong> 4 <br>
- 9 4 <br>
And now&hellip;<br>
The answer is <strong> 5 </strong></p>

<p>I wrote a program in Ruby that calculates prefix. Here&rsquo;s a snippet of a part of its code (the other methods I didn&rsquo;t include because I felt they were self-explanatory):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def calculate_prefix
</span><span class='line'>  stack = []
</span><span class='line'>  # @arg is the prefix expression
</span><span class='line'>  loopSize = @arg.count
</span><span class='line'>    for i in 0..loopSize
</span><span class='line'>    value = @arg.pop
</span><span class='line'>      if operand?(value)
</span><span class='line'>        stack &lt;&lt; value
</span><span class='line'>      elsif operator?(value)
</span><span class='line'>        operator1 = stack.pop
</span><span class='line'>        operator2 = stack.pop
</span><span class='line'>        stack &lt;&lt; compute(value, operator1, operator2)
</span><span class='line'>      end
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>    stack.compact.first
</span><span class='line'>  end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice I am making an array called stack. In Ruby, an array can pretty much function as a stack. In other languages, there is an actual stack datatype. Stack is a last-in-first-out data structure. You can make a Ruby implementation of a stack which RubyMonk demonstrates <a href = "https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/33-advanced-arrays/lessons/86-stacks-and-queues">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Basically the last thing I push into a stack will be the first thing I can pull out. So if using a Ruby array, there are just two array methods I would use to simulate a stack. As demonstrated below.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># adding to a stack
</span><span class='line'>  stack &lt;&lt; something
</span><span class='line'># retrieving from a stack
</span><span class='line'>  stack.pop</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can tell I used both of those in my calculating prefix method.</p>

<p>So an explanation of my method:
I&rsquo;m reading the prefix expression from right to left, popping a value from it. If the value is an operand, I will be pushing it onto my stack. Otherwise, if it is an operator, I&rsquo;ll pop the first two elements in my stack and compute them before pushing them to the stack again.</p>

<p>You can tell this is a lot easier than if I were to calculate infix directly.</p>

<p>Prefix might not be the easiest way for me to read an expression but it makes it easier for me to deal with coding a simple calculator. It&rsquo;s convenience over convention.</p>

			Some TDD Practice</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to be practicing my TDD by implementing a set in Ruby using arrays. While the Set class in Ruby uses hashes as storage for various reasons, this is just for practicing a TDD way of coding and also practice for writing tests in RSpec. So I&rsquo;m not trying to demonstrate a great way of implementing sets or that this is a better way to do sets (spoiler: It&rsquo;s really not).</p>

<p><strong>Some things to know about Sets:</strong>
<br>
- Order doesn&rsquo;t matter (unordered)
<br>
- Contains unique values</p>

<p>So the TDD steps&hellip; you would want to write tests first and let that guide how you write your code. You would first write a simple test, run it, see it fail and then write minimal code to make it pass (The simplest way you can make it pass). Then you move on to write the next test.</p>

<p>First things first, we are going to write a test. We are going to say what the test is describing. It will be something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Set do
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we are going to think about what kind of method we want the set to have.</p>

<p>For a quick example, let&rsquo;s say you want to convert the set into an array. So we are going to write a test for that.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Set do
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  describe "#to_array" do
</span><span class='line'>      it "returns an array of all elements in the set" do
</span><span class='line'>        @set = Set.new([1])
</span><span class='line'>        expect(@set.to_array).to contain_exactly(1)
</span><span class='line'>      end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note: This test is failing</p>

<p><img src="/images/testfail.png"></p>

<p>(You can ignore the number &ldquo;3)&rdquo; there. I screenshotted the fail message only after I finished this exercise so I already have a couple tests written)</p>

<p>As we haven&rsquo;t really written anything, the test will fail when we run it which is exactly what we want. Now we have to write some code to make the test pass.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Set
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  def initialize(array)
</span><span class='line'>    @array = array
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  def to_array
</span><span class='line'>    @array
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With this, the test now passes. Great!</p>

<p>Now, we can add more stuff in. Let&rsquo;s write another test to make sure only arrays can get passed as arguments. As Ruby is not a type language, we cannot specify what data types we accept as an argument.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>it "accepts only an array as an argument" do
</span><span class='line'>    expect(Set.new([1,2,3]).to_array).to contain_exactly(1,2,3)
</span><span class='line'>    expect(Set.new(1).to_array).to contain_exactly()
</span><span class='line'>    expect(Set.new("a").to_array).to contain_exactly()
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The test expects that if the argument is not an array, a set is made but it will be an empty set. It&rsquo;s important to note that our task is to write tests that fail. So even though the first expect line we write will pass, the other two will not.</p>

<p>To make this next step pass:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def initialize(array)
</span><span class='line'>  if array.class != Array
</span><span class='line'>    @array = []
</span><span class='line'>  else
</span><span class='line'>    @array = array
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can worry about one of the definitions of a set - that it contains only unique values. And we can write a test for that.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>it "will create a set with unique elements" do
</span><span class='line'>    expect(Set.new([1, 1, 2]).to_array).to contain_exactly(1, 2) 
</span><span class='line'>end
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To make this pass, we can call .uniq on the argument like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def initialize(array)
</span><span class='line'>  if array.class != Array
</span><span class='line'>    @array = []
</span><span class='line'>  else
</span><span class='line'>    @array = array.uniq
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>.uniq might not be the best way to do things, but it is important to keep in mind that at the moment, we are just concerned with doing the minimal to make the test pass.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go through each and every one of my tests but eventually I found myself creating new sets for each test. So in my test file, I ended up doing:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>before :each do
</span><span class='line'>  @shortset = Set.new([1])
</span><span class='line'>  @mediumset = Set.new([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].shuffle)
</span><span class='line'>  @mediumset2 = Set.new([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].shuffle)
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This way I won&rsquo;t have to keep making new tests. Before each means that before each test, that block of code will run. So less repetition! I added the .shuffle because sets are not ordered. Before that, I had put in arrays in numerical order and didn&rsquo;t realize some tests actually failed when numerical order was not in place. Ideally, I think something I would change are the names of the sets as they aren&rsquo;t very descriptive. There&rsquo;s also a bit of refactoring to be done but the idea of TDD is to do the minimum to pass the tests and then write more tests that you expect to fail.</p>

<p>Overall, there&rsquo;s still some refactoring to be done but I quite like the practice I got with writing tests before the actual coding. I like TDD because it forces you to think before you code. You have to think about what you will be doing. And once the tests pass (there really is no better feeling&hellip;), you know that your job is done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still tinkering around with it (with refactoring and such) but the full code can be viewed on github: <a href = "https://github.com/heatherlim/TDDPractice">HERE</a></p>

		<p>For my final project, my group members and I were creating an app that would track prices of a selected item over time. Shoppers could add their items to a closet and &ldquo;follow&rdquo; other fellow shoppers. So there was a little bit of a social media aspect to it. This was tracked by an activity feed.

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;% elsif activity.trackable.class == User && activity.action == "destroy" %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>              &lt;em class="text-muted"&gt;unfollowed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;%= activity.trackable.username %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;% end %&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and&hellip; congratz. You made it to the end. It&rsquo;s kinda gross and awful. So let&rsquo;s think about how to fix that. First off, the activity feed was living in the boards index. I decided to move it over to a partial so the boards index.html.erb page now would just show this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'> &lt;%= render partial: 'boards/activity_feed', locals: {user: @user}%&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But that still doesn&rsquo;t solve all that logic in the view! So right now I&rsquo;m thinking that I require a view object of some sort to handle the logic&hellip;</p>

<p>One issue that cropped up is the styling. When a user adds an item to a closet, they should get a message that would kinda look like this:</p>

<p><em>added</em> mediocre rubber pants <em>to</em> whatever closet</p>

<p>How was I supposed to selectively add styling to a whole message?</p>

<p>So at first I thought oh great all I have to do is put this in the view object:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>and then all I have to do is call html_safe on the partial</p>

<p>But&hellip;. wait up, we don&rsquo;t want to have any html in our view object. It&rsquo;s kinda icky. One of the points of the view object is to separate the html from the logic.</p>

<p>But the styling was giving me a lot of issues. How could I make sure that only some text remained muted when I was getting back an entire string?</p>

<p>The solution for me was to add more methods into my view object. And that&rsquo;s ok.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s already looking a lot better, half the size it was before and way more readable.</p>

<p>Refactoring is definitely a process for me and it involves many little edits along the way.</p>

			Methods of Sorting and a Bit of Trailing Around From There</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While working on my sorting program, I came across several interesting methods that I didn&rsquo;t know before. While I haven&rsquo;t used any of them in my project thus far, I still found them pretty cool. From there I normally go on long google crawls until sometimes I learn things completely unrelated but still pretty cool. So this blog post is about my train of thought and how I get from sorting to something else entirely.</p>

<p>The first two methods I played around with were array methods called permutation and combination.</p>

<p>An example of permutation:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[1, 2, 3].permutation.to_a
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
</span><span class='line'>[1, 2, 3].permutation(2).to_a
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2]]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>An example of combination:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[1, 2, 3].combination(2).to_a
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]] </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Combination requires you to put in an argument while permutation does not. Permutation defaults to the number of elements in the array. Also notable is that there are always going to be more permutations than combinations because combination takes order of the elements into account so [1, 2] and [2, 1] are considered the same.</p>

<p>So how could I find all combinations in an array of people so that every person in the array would have met exactly once? So a group of Mary and Tom would be considered the same as a group of Tom and Mary. Well&hellip; there&rsquo;s a gem for that. It&rsquo;s called the round robin tournmanet gem. And I&rsquo;ll provide a link at the bottom.</p>

<p>This is a portion of its  code that I copied from its github repository:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def self.schedule(array)
</span><span class='line'>    array.push nil if array.size.odd?
</span><span class='line'>    n = array.size
</span><span class='line'>    pivot = array.pop
</span><span class='line'>    games = (n - 1).times.map do
</span><span class='line'>      array.rotate!
</span><span class='line'>      [[array.first, pivot]] + (1...(n / 2)).map { |j| [array[j], array[n - 1 - j]] }
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>    array.push pivot unless pivot.nil?
</span><span class='line'>    games
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  # running it will give...
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  self.schedule(a)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; [[[2, 4], [3, 1]], [[3, 4], [1, 2]], [[1, 4], [2, 3]]] </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty cool!</p>

<p>Interestingly enough however, while I find methods that work for sorting unique pairs, unique trios and so on&hellip; they all function very differently so I&rsquo;m still looking for one that could work in all cases for my sorting project.</p>

<p>Another method I found helpful is a rails method called in_groups_of. It is used to split an array into groups of whatever number is put inside the argument.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of its usage:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>%w(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10).in_groups_of(3) {|group| p group}
</span><span class='line'>["1", "2", "3"]
</span><span class='line'>["4", "5", "6"]
</span><span class='line'>["7", "8", "9"]
</span><span class='line'>["10", nil, nil]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The example I saw was the first time I saw %w in use too. Putting the %w makes it so the elements are split up by the whitespace. So I would be able to get the same result if I had typed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].in_groups_of(3) as well.</p>

<p>Note that it padded the last group with nil. There&rsquo;s a way around that if that isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;re looking for. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>%w(1 2 3 4 5).in_groups_of(2, false) {|group| p group}
</span><span class='line'>["1", "2"]
</span><span class='line'>["3", "4"]
</span><span class='line'>["5"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here you can see there is a second argument placed. When false is written there, it will not pad the remaining spaces left over from the uneven grouping. Aside from false, you can also place anything else in there and the method will use that to pad the empty spaces.</p>

<p>This method however is only available in rails. In ruby there is a similar method called each_slice.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(1..10).each_slice(3) {|a| p a}
</span><span class='line'># outputs below
</span><span class='line'>[1, 2, 3]
</span><span class='line'>[4, 5, 6]
</span><span class='line'>[7, 8, 9]
</span><span class='line'>[10]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Aside from a range, it is also possible to use it on an array. Both of those methods work similar to the way my sorting program does. But it divides up an array based on how many elements one wants inside each new group rather than the group number.</p>

<p>Something random I found interesting when I was experimenting was that when I called .class on the result of each_slice, I was getting a NilClass.</p>

<p>What I copied from my cmd line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.2 :010 &gt; (1..10).each_slice(3) {|a| p a}
</span><span class='line'>[1, 2, 3]
</span><span class='line'>[4, 5, 6]
</span><span class='line'>[7, 8, 9]
</span><span class='line'>[10]
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; nil 
</span><span class='line'>2.2.2 :011 &gt; _.class
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; NilClass </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I thought it was interesting because I was using &lsquo;p&rsquo; in the {|a| p a } part. A distinction between p and puts would be that p normally returns to me the actual class. Not nil. Maybe it returned nile because of something to do with the iteration? I&rsquo;m not too sure.</p>

<p>Distinguising p and puts example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>

<p>p calls on .inspect. Notie that the return value is not nil. So it was odd for me that in the each slice example it gave me a nil return value. I experimented a bit further with each slice to see what puts and print would give me if I placed it where the p was.</p>

<p>print:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>[1, 2, 3][4, 5, 6][7, 8, 9][10] =&gt; nil </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Considering that print was like puts but does not add a new line, I was not too surprised to see this.</p>

<p>But when I used puts&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>It surprised me that it did not actually output the arrays but just the whole range. I&rsquo;m not too sure why it did that. I assume on the first iteration a is [1, 2, 3] and so on&hellip; and used a pry to confirm it was too. So I wonder why it prints out the whole range instead of the array.</p>

			Things Coming Round Again and the Importance of Thinking Before Coding</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m still working on my cute random group sample code because spending hours solving a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that probably takes up just ten minutes of your time doing manually is a fun thing to do. It really is.</p>

<p>Anyway, it has made a lot of progress from before. I remembered that I was so uncomfortable with classes two weeks ago&hellip; and now&hellip; well I&rsquo;m still not as comfortable as I&rsquo;d like to be but I&rsquo;m actually using them now which is a plus. Something I learned while working on this is that sometimes the best way to solve a problem is the simplest approach. I was so excited about using .sample that I ignored some of the more obvious methods to use. Instead, I used .sample and .pop to pull random people from the array.</p>

<p>This is a section of my original code:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def random_group(people, groupnumber)
</span><span class='line'>  random_person = people.sample
</span><span class='line'>  binding.pry
</span><span class='line'>  group_array = [] 
</span><span class='line'>   Array.new(groupnumber) {people.sample }
</span><span class='line'>    people.each do |each_person|
</span><span class='line'>      if each_person != random_person
</span><span class='line'>        group_array &lt;&lt; random_person
</span><span class='line'>        people.delete_if {|repeat_person| repeat_person == random_person}
</span><span class='line'>        binding.pry
</span><span class='line'>      elsif each_person == random_person
</span><span class='line'>        people.delete_if {|repeat_person| repeat_person == random_person}
</span><span class='line'>      end     
</span><span class='line'>    end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you can&rsquo;t decipher what the hell is going on, that&rsquo;s fine because it didn&rsquo;t work and I could barely tell myself what I was doing. First warning sign I suppose that I should find a different approach.</p>

<p>My problem I outlined in my previous post was that .sample would take a random person out of the array but there when the method was run again, there was still a chance to pick the same person out of the array. The person wasn&rsquo;t actually removed in the array. While I had thought I could use .pop, that method would not be random.</p>

<p>The solution was to use .shuffle before .pop was used. This way, I can now pick random people out of the array until it was empty. I wasted a lot of time with .sample because I was too focused in using .sample than using the right tool for the job. I&rsquo;m not saying using .sample is impossible but .shuffle and .pop made mroe sense to me.</p>

<p>Now my code has two methods that make the hash and fill it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def create_groups 
</span><span class='line'>     range = (1..@groupnumber).to_a
</span><span class='line'>     range.each do |indgroup| # 1, 2, 3, 4...
</span><span class='line'>     @groups["group" + " " + "#{indgroup}"] = []
</span><span class='line'>    end  
</span><span class='line'>    @groups
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  def filling_group
</span><span class='line'>    people_number = @people.count/@groupnumber
</span><span class='line'>    range = (1..@groupnumber).to_a
</span><span class='line'>     range.each do |indgroup|
</span><span class='line'>        @groups["group" + " " + "#{indgroup}"] &lt;&lt; @people.shuffle!.pop(people_number)    
</span><span class='line'>          @groups.values.each do |x|
</span><span class='line'>            x.flatten!
</span><span class='line'>         end
</span><span class='line'>     end 
</span><span class='line'>  end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With this, I had fulfilled the first goal I set. Right now, my code could create x number of groups for x amount of people. I added the code below as well so that it would be possible for people to be divided into groups even if the groups were uneven. Like 20 people could be divided into 7 groups and so on.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def if_uneven
</span><span class='line'>    range = (1..@people.count).to_a
</span><span class='line'>    range.each do |indgroup|
</span><span class='line'>      @groups["group" + " " + "#{indgroup}"] &lt;&lt; @people.shuffle!.pop
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After people are sorted into groups, the remaining number of people would in the people array would be iterated through again and distributed amoungst the groups already made.</p>

<p>And now comes the part where thinking ahead would have really helped me out. I had thought that being able to sort people randomly into groups was the first step in my project. The second step would be to show all other unique possibilities of groups. Though I could keep running the program, it does not actually &ldquo;remember&rdquo; the last distribution it made. So it is highly possible that if Person 1 and Person 2 were paired together, they could be paired together again whether in the same group or a different one.</p>

<p>I spent awhile thinking about how to make the program remember what groups each person was put into and make sure they&rsquo;d never be in a group where some of their original group mates were. Should I use databases to store this information? Or I could make an even bigger hash. I could place</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>groups = {
</span><span class='line'>  :group1 =&gt; [],
</span><span class='line'>  :group2 =&gt; [],
</span><span class='line'>  :group3 =&gt; [],
</span><span class='line'>  :group4 =&gt; [],
</span><span class='line'>  :group5 =&gt; []
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>into a hash with values of days. So it would be Day 1 => groups&hellip; Day 2 => groups&hellip;</p>

<p>But then I realized that my problem was a symptom of not thinking ahead. If I were going to list out all possible unique combinations, why the hell was I randomizing it? Instead, I needed a method that would pick out the groups in the exact same way each time.</p>

<p>So thinking ahead would have saved me a lot of time though in the end I still learned a lot. Though just for more practice I decided to try make my program into a webapp to get more familiar with sinatra. The final result is a page that would show groups and their random distribution whenever it gets refreshed. Eventually I&rsquo;d like to make a form where people can simply input the number of groups they want and the people they want to sort.</p>

			Why I Had Problems With Arrays/Hashes/Pigeons... (and What Else I Learned)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Iteration was my first challenge that I didn&rsquo;t really know what to make of. I went through great pains to not use it. On the first lab where we had to write a method that could tel if a number was prime or not, instead of iterating through the whole array range to see if there were more than two zeroes (the array represented the number being divided by 1 to that particular number. So the first element in the array would be that number divided by one, the second element would be that number divided by two and so on&hellip; if the number was prime, the modulo should return only two 0s), I would instead sort the array and check if array[2] == 0.</p>

<p>So already by avoiding it, I made it harder for myself to pick up. It was probably the first method that didn&rsquo;t look to be in plain English for me. It was pretty abstract.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>basket = ["apple 1","apple 2","apple 3","apple 4","apple 5","apple 6","apple 7","apple 8","apple 9","apple 10"]
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>basket.each do |apple|
</span><span class='line'>    puts "Taking out #{apple}"
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It didn&rsquo;t click until later that the word between the | | could be anything. In this case it is apple because it describes each element of the array that is picked up. But it is only for ease of understanding. It could be |oranges| for all the program cares.</p>

<p>It also helped me to visualize what&rsquo;s going on. Basically it was as though a pedantic person was going over each item in the array one by one and then executing whatever the instructions below told him to. So apple (or whatever is between the ||) would be equal to the string &ldquo;apple 1&rdquo; and then &ldquo;apple 2&rdquo; and so on&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a step by step process that I guess I could read as for each item in the array, do this to that item. And that started to make it clearer for me rather than what I thinking before. That it was some kind of magic thing that did something all at once. Figuring out the plain English equivalent made it also easier for me to finish the pigeon hash lab where we had to sort out pigeons by their names and attributes. The tricky part was understanding what exactly you were getting between those ||.</p>

<p>Because I found iteration difficult, on my own time, I decided to make a cute program that would be able to take in a bunch of people and divide them into however many groups the user would want. The program would return different groups each time it was run.</p>

<p>For example, while the input would look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>people = ["Adrian", "Polly", "John", "Ivan", "Jack", "Tom", "Anna", "Mary", "Ben", "Jeff",
</span><span class='line'>"Alex", "Megan", "Helen", "Sarah", "Wei", "Aristo", "Jane", "Meredith", "Liz", "Lacey"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output will be in this format:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>groups = {
</span><span class='line'>   :group1 =&gt; [-names here-],
</span><span class='line'>   :group2 =&gt; [-names here-],
</span><span class='line'>   :group3 =&gt; [-names here-],
</span><span class='line'>   :group4 =&gt; [-names here-],
</span><span class='line'>   :group5 =&gt; [-names here-]
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Because I wanted to find a random person from the people array, I thought why not find a random number with rand() and make the number inside rand to be people.count? Then, if I named that variable something, I could call it into people[random] and it should return a random person from the array.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>random = rand(people.count)
</span><span class='line'>  people[random]
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After this, I would be able to shovel in random people into their arrays as long as the people inside each of their arrays would not exceed the people.length/groupnumber. Which makes sense because if the array has 20 people in it, and we want to make five groups, each group would have four people in it.</p>

<p>However, even though I made progress with feeling more comfortable with iteration, I found it difficult to return a different random person each time so my groups would always be filled with the same random person. My logic was something like how can I iterate over my random variable if it wasn&rsquo;t an array? Then I tried some stuff with iterating over the people array and only shoveling in each person if the person value was equal to the random person value&hellip;</p>

<p>In any case, it didn&rsquo;t quite work out and I found a different method to get four different people into the array. So first I wanted to make an array with variables in it equal to the number of people I wanted in the group. So let that variable be called people_in_group (which would be the length of the people array divided by the number of groups we want).</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Array.new(people_in_group)
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now this should create an array with a bunch of nils. But we can use .sample</p>

<p>.sample can choose a random element from the array</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Array.new(people_in_group){people.sample}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will fill the new array with random people until the number of elements it has is equal to the number of people we want in the group.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m working on making sure there are no repeated people inside each array. Then I will make sure the people do not repeat in each group.</p>

<p>So hopefully completing this mini program will help me out further with iteration and sorting. In any case, maybe I&rsquo;ll be qualified enough as an entry-level pigeon sorter.</p>

<p>My current trouble is now with classes. So hopefully by the next time I make another post I&rsquo;ll be confident enough to write a little about it.</p>
